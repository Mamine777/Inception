# Inception

## ðŸš€ Project Summary

This project is part of the 42 curriculum and focuses on system administration using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**. The goal is to virtualize an infrastructure consisting of multiple services inside Docker containers. I have built and configured everything from scratch, including custom Dockerfiles, secure networking, and service orchestration.

## ðŸ“¦ What I Built

- **NGINX Container**
  - Serves as the single entry point via **HTTPS** (TLSv1.2/1.3 only)
  - Handles SSL certificate setup and reverse-proxy to WordPress

- **WordPress Container**
  - Uses **php-fpm** to run the PHP backend
  - Automatically installs and configures WordPress on first boot

- **MariaDB Container**
  - Stores the WordPress data
  - Secured with separate root and user passwords
  - All credentials are passed through environment variables

- **Volumes**
  - One volume for the **WordPress website files**
  - Another volume for the **WordPress database**

- **Networking**
  - All containers are connected through a private Docker network
  - No use of `host`, `--link`, or similar deprecated features

- **Automation**
  - A `Makefile` to build and run everything automatically
  - Containers auto-restart if they crash
  - No infinite loops, no bad Docker practices like `tail -f`

- **Security**
  - Environment variables are used throughout
  - Sensitive credentials are stored in a `secrets/` folder and ignored by Git
  - The administrator username avoids "admin" variants as required
